Description: MuseScore Studio 3 (music composition and notation) shared files
 Demonstration scores and templates, styles, localisations,
 some plugins for Mu͒seScore Studio, the Open Source (GNU GPL)
 cross-platform multi-lingual music notation software.
 .
 In contrast to earlier versions, no sound font is provided by
 default, but the Depends ensure a suitable one is installed,
 normally the compact, full orchestral and band sound, one that
 is shipped with MuseScore from version 2.2 onwards, or its more
 limited 2.1 counterpart fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont. In general,
 any soundfont that Provides musescore-compatible-soundfont will
 be acceptable; if you installed multiple, run the following
 command to configure the default MuseScore soundfont (select
 “0” to ensure that the highest-quality soundfont is used):
 .
 $ sudo update-alternatives --config MuseScore_General.sf3

Description: cross-platform multi-lingual music composition and notation, v3
 Mu͒seScore Studio is an Open Source (GNU GPL) music notation software
 that runs on all platforms supported by Qt5 (GNU/Linux, MacOS X, Windows)
 and is available in over forty different languages. It features an
 easy to use WYSIWYG editor with audio score playback for results that
 look and sound beautiful, rivaling commercial offerings.
 .
 This package provides a (tastefully cherry-picked) Mu͒seScore Studio 3.
 It is possible, even recommended, to install multiple versions of
 Mu͒seScore Studio in parallel because each major version has a new,
 incompatible, layout engine; the old version is needed to change
 scores made with the old version if not investing several hours of
 effort to relayout under the new version.
 Install the musescore Debian package for Mu͒seScore Studio 2,
 musescore-snapshot for “Mu͒seScore 3 Evolution” which is maintained by a
 community team. Mu͒seScore Studio 4 relies on proprietary, binary-only
 downloadable content for most functionality, so no Debian package is
 currently planned for the releases by the new (Muse Group) owners.
 .

 Choir features:

  - implode/explode: combine up to four voices on one staff,
    then separate to individual staves
  - hide empty vocal staves, such as in a piano intro
  - figured bass for historical notation
  - smart lyrics: unlimited verses, with notes and staves automatically
    spaced, and verse numbers automatically aligned
  - voice leading checker: download the Check Harmony Rules proofreading
    plugin to check for errors in your part writing, according to
    standard rules
  - part mixer: mute, solo, or change volume of staves to learn
    individual lines — settings even apply to MP3 export
 .
 Piano features:
  - support for solo + piano (add small staff with different instrument)
  - support for cadenzas (smaller notes and variable length measures)
  - complete notation: pedaling, fingering, cross-staff beaming — you
    name it; everything needed to write piano sheet music is here
 .
 Guitar features:
  - bends, fingerings, and other common guitar notations supported
  - add/remove linked staves any time; enter notes on either standard
    (pitched five-line) or TAB staff
  - percussion/drumset also included
  - templates include guitar, tablature, guitar+tablature, rock/pop band
  - complete tablature: multiple tab styles available — from note symbols
    outside the staff to upside-down strings — and linked standard/tab
    staff pairs
  - Guitar Pro import: MuseScore can now open files from Guitar Pro, so
    you can easily migrate over. Import filters are improving with every
    release; GP3, GP4, GP5, GP6, GTP, GPX are currently supported.
  - Fretboard diagrams: 21 default chords for every key, and a powerful
    editor to create your own — with barre, fret position, and any number
    of strings
  - multiple or differently shaped dots per string; partial and multiple
    barres; ability to not show nut; customisable string/fret distance;
    chord symbols for diagrams and saving those to the palette; etc.
  - beyond guitar: banjo, mandolin, ukulele, oud; custom string tunings;
    even historical lute tablature: MuseScore does them all.
 .
 Orchestral features:
  - templates for common instrumentations
  - custom linked parts (e.g. create choral score from orchestra+chorus):
    any change you make to the content of any part is immediately
    reflected in the full score — and vice versa
  - powerful style controls: edit the formatting of parts and score
    independently — or apply the same style to all parts with one click
  - one-click transposition: instantly switch between transposed and
    concert pitch: sounding pitches stay the same while the written notes
    change
 .
 Jazz features:
  - templates for Jazz Lead Sheet, Big Band and Jazz Combo
  - real “handwritten” Book-style jazz font for text and chord symbols
  - formatting tools include adding line breaks every X measures
  - instantly switch between transposed and concert pitch
  - intelligent chord symbol: chord names are automatically formatted
    when you finish typing — plus, they transpose with the notes
  - easy slashes: commands to fill bars with slashes — and to turn notes
    into rhythmic slashes, and even accent notation above the staff
 .
 Marching ensembles features (needs the MDL extension):
  - marching band, indoor percussion, front ensemble, drumline and drum
    corps (even G bugles); no setup or configuration — select a template,
    start writing
 .
 Band features:
  - diverse templates: concert band, brass band, marching band, battery
    and pit percussion — ready out-of-the-box (plus big band for jazz)
  - custom linked parts: you can even keep a drumline score linked to a
    full marching band score and to individual percussion parts
 .
 Most elements in MuseScore are laid out automatically on a “virtual note
 sheet”, with a near professional-quality layout engine, but can also be
 positioned manually, giving you total control of every score element’s
 position. The capabilities of MuseScore can be extended via plugins and
 extensions, and the growing repository on musescore.org contains many
 plugins submitted by users and an active development team.
 .
 MuseScore includes a set of sounds that reproduce common instruments (as
 defined by General MIDI) without taking up a lot of disk space or memory
 providing full orchestral and band sounds (with the Drumline extension
 installed this includes marching percussion). The general (non-Drumline)
 sound font is available as musescore-general-soundfont Debian package,
 if you wish to reuse it with other synthesisers.) You can also load any
 sound font you prefer for a wider variety of sounds or for more realism.
 .
 MuseScore can import and export MIDI and MusicXML files, and it can also
 import from Capella and several other programs. MuseScore can export to
 PDF, PNG, and other graphic formats, to WAV and other audio formats such
 as OGG Vorbis and MP3, or to GNU Lilypond for an alternative layout and
 print option.
 .
 Mu͒seScore Studio scores can be uploaded to Scusemore Catalogue and used
 with the Mu͒seScore Sheet Music for Android and iOS äpps to rehearse “on
 the go” (they do not support note entry but advanced playback functions).
 Note that these are commercial and proprietary offers, not part of the
 notation program (which is FOSS). Scusemore Catalogue can send scrolling
 videos to YouTube, which highlight the notes as they sound in the score
 and on a virtual piano keyboard.
